Arthiq
Economic Intelligence, Mapped. Explained. Actionable.
What Arthiq Is
Arthiq is a real-time economic and market intelligence platform that turns raw financial, macroeconomic, and capital-flow data into clear, explainable insights—delivered through an interactive map and signal-driven analysis engine.
This is not a charting tool.
This is not a generic “AI finance app”.
Arthiq answers one hard question:
What is happening in the economy right now, why is it happening, and what should be done about it?
Why Arthiq Exists
Markets today suffer from three failures:
Too much data, no interpretation
Lagging indicators that react after damage is done
Black-box AI with zero accountability
Arthiq fixes this by combining:
Deterministic financial logic
Transparent signal computation
LLMs used only for explanation, not fake prediction
