Arthiq
Economic Intelligence, Mapped. Explained. Actionable.
What Arthiq Is
Arthiq is a real-time economic and market intelligence platform that transforms financial, macroeconomic, and capital-flow data into clear, explainable insights.
Instead of dumping charts or opaque AI predictions, Arthiq answers:
What is happening right now, why it is happening, and what it means.
Why Arthiq Exists
Modern markets fail in three ways:
Data overload without interpretation
Lagging indicators that react after damage is done
Black-box AI with no accountability
Arthiq fixes this by combining deterministic market logic with explainable AI interpretation — not fake prediction engines.
Core Principle
Data → Signal → Insight → Action
Every output in Arthiq can be traced back to:
Raw data
Computed signals
Clear reasoning
Nothing is hidden. Nothing is hand-waved.
